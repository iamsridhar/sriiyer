It is hard not to be in awe of the amazing sights in our nation's capital. The majesty of the buildings and monuments reflects the true spirit of this country. For lovers of history, DC is paradise! There's so much history there, and all of it is excellently preserved and packaged. The original founding documents, the flag that flew on Fort Mc. Henry (it's way bigger than I imagined, btw), original items belonging to our founding fathers like Washington and Jefferson -- and all of this is entirely free to view.

The Smithsonian institution has so many wonderful museums too; Natural History, American History, and African American History were my favorites, and the National Art Gallery itself requires like a week to see in its entirety. Enjoy these pictures from my visit there!
