I believe in the transformative power of technology in creating a better world for people, and I’m excited and optimistic about the incredible possibilities it holds.

Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to work on some of the world’s most impactful products, like the Windows Operating System, Bing Search, Twitter, Facebook, to now building Reels and short-form-video for Instagram.

When I’m not geeking out over tech, you can find me enjoying life in the beautiful Pacific Northwest with my family.

##### Facebook Groups and Communities

I led Engineering for Facebook’s Communities team. My team built safe and rewarding communities that are simple and efficient to manage. Communities are essential for Facebook because they allow people to connect with others who share their interests and passions. Communities enable people to form deeper connections with others and build meaningful relationships, which are fundamental to the success of the Facebook platform.
