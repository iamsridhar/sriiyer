A technologist at heart, and that's about all I know to do. Been lucky to have had the chance to work on some iconic products like Windows, Bing, Twitter, and Facebook. At Instagram, leading the charge on all things content creation—Reels, posts, carousels, etc. I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest with my family, and try to get in a hike or two when it's not raining :-)

##### Facebook Groups and Communities

I led Engineering for Facebook’s Communities team. My team built safe and rewarding communities that are simple and efficient to manage. Communities are essential for Facebook because they allow people to connect with others who share their interests and passions. Communities enable people to form deeper connections with others and build meaningful relationships, which are fundamental to the success of the Facebook platform.
